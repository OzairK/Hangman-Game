Hangman-Game
A classic Hangman Game using JavaScript and color words only. It counts wins, counts down guesses until a lose, displays the mystery word in spaces, fills in the correctly guessed letters, and displays a picture when finished. It doesn't show an actual man being hung because that's kind of gross.

Instructions
Press any key to get started. Continue pressing keys to guess.
